## Choices
- I choose for Html and Javascript
- Because i had used Html and Javascript before and because i knew i could use Electron from javascript to build a Browser window

## Known Limitations
- The locations that are listed are self added and if you want to add a location it needs to be in the code itself.
- it's put on an hourly rate and you cant change that in the browser itself.
- There are no images
- After so many refreshes it gets an error, because we can use the api only so many times.

## Things to add
1. More locations and making it easier to add locations and suchs.
2. Changing the hour rate for it, like every 3 hours weather or every day weather.
3. adding some images.
